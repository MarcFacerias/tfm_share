SRC
	controllerMain -> ROS node that uses objects created in ControllerObject to solve MPC problem and drive the vehicle. 
	plotCarTrajectory -> visualization module
	plannerMain -> MPC based planner
	stateEstimator -> Old implementation of the LMI EKF in python 
	vehicleSimulator -> simulator that solves the discrete system of eq 

ControllerObject
	PathFollowingLPV_MPC -> MPC implementation

data
	Observer_Gain -> all gain matrices are stored here, keep the folder structure and name of the files for proper imports. 

Utilities
	dataStructures -> clases used in the controller are defined (subscribers etc)
	trackInitialization -> Spline-based planner
	utilities -> useful functions 

Others -> Old files used in certain tests with IDIADA
	
	GatherData or similar -> subscribes and stores information from certain topics
	OnlineIntegration/TestRef -> Integrates a given plan to check correpondance between position and velocity
	PublishData -> publishes signals at a given freq. (usually extracted from IDIADA Bagfiles)

The rest of the folders inside lpv_control contain mostly message definitions or code used with the real robot (sensor libraries etc) test
